\subsection{Quick Recap}\label{quick-recap}}

    Recall that the binomial distribution describes the probability of a
success or a failure outcome in an experiment that is repeated multiple
times.

In fact, a binomial distribution describes a repeated bernoulli
experiment. A bernoulli experiment can be seen as one trial where there
is a known success rate \(p\). Examples: - Rolling a dice once where
success is defined as throwing a 5 or higher, the probability of success
is 1/3. - Shooting at a basketball rink where the success probability is
70\%. - etc.

    The binomial distribution then has 2 parameters: \(n\) and \(p\), where
\(n\) is the number of independent experiments.

    The binomial and hypergeometric distribution describe the number of
successes in a fixed number, independent repetitions of Bernoulli
experiments. The negative binomial and geometric distribution describe
the number of independent repetitions to a \emph{fixed} number of
\emph{successes}. The geometric distribution is a special case of the
negative-binomial distribution.

To be more specific, the geometric distribution is the probability for
which trial the first successful Bernoulli experiment will occur on. The
more general version of this is the negative binomial distribution which
is the probability for which trial the nth success will occur on.

\subsection{1. Let's take a look at the classic coin flipping
case.}\label{lets-take-a-look-at-the-classic-coin-flipping-case.}}

\textbf{A)} What's the probability that the first success occurs on the
1st trial? (Yes its that intuitive.)

    \#Your answer here

    \textbf{B)} What's the probability that the first success occurs on the
2nd trial?\\
(Hint: Think of all the possible scenarios: Either the success occured
on the first trial, the success occurred on the second trial, or there
still was no success. These three scenarios should encompass all
possible scenarios and thus have a total probability of 1. Calculate the
probability that the first trial was successful. Calculate the
probability that neither the first nor second trial was successful. It
should now be straightforward to calculate the final scenario: that the
second trial was the original success.)

\subsection{4. Product Failures take 2}\label{product-failures-take-2}}

In many cases, a manufacturer might only test a sample of the products
for defaults. Assuming 95\% of the products do indeed work, what is the
probability that in testing 20 units, that none will be defective?

\subsection{5. Consumer Profiling}\label{consumer-profiling}}

A previous sample showed that 70\% of U.S. shoppers prefer to buy
groceries in store as compared to online.\\
Calculate the probability that the 6th person interviewed is the first
to prefer to buy groceries online.

    \hypertarget{consumer-profiling-2}{%
\subsection{6. Consumer Profiling 2}\label{consumer-profiling-2}}

What is the probability that at least 6 people have to be interviewed
before finding someone who prefers to buy groceries online? (Assuming
the statistic is true.)

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor} }]:} \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{}Code and answer here}
        \PY{n}{prob} \PY{o}{=}

\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

Awesome, you've now learned about many use cases for the geometric and
negative binomial distribution!
